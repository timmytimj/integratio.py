TC-Zee - Scapy-based library to create and manage TCP connection. Allows to send data over a TCP connection automatically keeping track of SEQ and ACK numbers, 3-way handshake and connection tear-down, maintaining the low level control provided by Scapy, when needed. The purpose of this project is to provide a convenient way to verify network component robustness and compliance to the standards at the different level of the ISO-OSI stack.
